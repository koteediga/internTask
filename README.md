<summary>Home Route</summary>

## Home Route

The **Home Route** (`/`) is the main entry point of the application. When you visit this route, it will display a list of users fetched from the **JSONPlaceholder API**. This route is responsible for:

- Fetching and displaying a list of users.
- Providing a link to view the details of each user.
- Enabling the dark mode and light mode toggle functionality.

### Features:
- Displays a paginated list of users.
- Each user can be clicked to view more detailed information.
- Supports both light and dark themes, which can be toggled by the user.</details>

<details>
<summary>UserrDetails Route</summary>

## UserDetails Page

The **UserDetails Page** (`/user/:id`) is responsible for displaying detailed information about a specific user. When a user clicks on a specific user from the Home Route, they are navigated to this page, where more detailed information about the user is shown. The page fetches user data from the **JSONPlaceholder API** using the `id` parameter passed in the URL.

### Features:
- Displays detailed information such as:
  - Name
  - Username
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - Address
  - Company information
  - Website link
- Supports dark and light themes, which adjust the text color, background color, and button styles.
- Provides a **Back Button** to navigate back to the Home Route.

### URL Structure:
- **Route:** `/user/:id`
  - The `:id` is a dynamic parameter representing the unique ID of the user.

Example of user URL:
- `/user/1`

**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- Render `Home` Route component when the path in URL matches `/`
- Render `UserDetails` Route component when the path in URL matches `/:id`

- Render `Not Found` Route component when the path in URL matches `/not-found`
- No need to use the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` as we have already included in `index.js`

- Wrap the `Loader` component with an HTML container element and add the `data-testid` attribute value as **loader** to it

  ```jsx
  <div className="loader-container" data-testid="loader">
    <Loader type="ThreeDots" color="#ffffff" height="50" width="50" />
  </div>
  ```
